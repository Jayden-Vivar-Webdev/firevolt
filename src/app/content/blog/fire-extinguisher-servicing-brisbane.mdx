# Top Fire Extinguisher Problems and Why Regular Servicing Matters

When it comes to fire safety, fire extinguishers are critical in stopping small fires before they become serious emergencies. But your extinguisher is only reliable if it’s regularly maintained. Without scheduled servicing, even the best extinguishers can fail right when they’re needed most.

This article highlights the most common fire extinguisher issues like leakage, low pressure, expiry, and physical damage and how professional servicing ensures your fire safety equipment remains compliant and ready to perform.

## Why Regular Fire Extinguisher Servicing Is Essential

Under **Australian Standard AS1851-2012**, all fire extinguishers must be inspected every six months. These checks are designed to:

- Identify early signs of faults or wear
- Ensure extinguishers are pressurised and functional
- Maintain compliance with Queensland fire safety laws
- Prevent failure during emergency use

## Common Fire Extinguisher Problems in Brisbane

### 1. Leakage

Leaks often go unnoticed and reduce internal pressure, rendering the extinguisher ineffective. They usually occur due to:

- Worn or faulty valves
- Cracked or damaged seals

**Solution:** During servicing, technicians inspect and replace compromised components or the full unit if needed.

### 2. Low Pressure

Pressure loss can occur through partial discharge or incorrect storage, and extinguishers without enough pressure won’t work in an emergency.

**Solution:** Pressure gauges are checked, and units are recharged if pressure is outside the safe zone.

### 3. Expired Units

All extinguishers have a shelf life. Expired models may contain degraded agents or faulty mechanisms.

**Solution:** Servicing professionals track expiry dates and replace units before they become unsafe or non-compliant.

### 4. Corrosion and Physical Damage

Fire extinguishers in high-humidity or industrial environments may suffer from rust or damage, compromising their integrity.

**Solution:** Units are visually inspected for signs of corrosion or structural compromise and replaced as required.

### 5. Tampering or Accidental Discharge

Safety pins can be removed accidentally or extinguishers discharged unintentionally. This affects their readiness.

**Solution:** Servicing includes checking for tampering and restoring discharged units to full working order.
