# What Are The Fire Extinguisher Signage Requirements in Brisbane

Fire safety regulations in Australia vary by state and in Queensland including Brisbane there are strict compliance rules that building owners and managers must follow. Whether you own a commercial property, lease a space, or manage a building, you are legally responsible for ensuring the safety of occupants during a fire or emergency situation.

A key part of this responsibility involves meeting fire extinguisher signage requirements. These visual indicators are not just a formality they play a crucial role in helping people quickly locate and understand how to use firefighting equipment during an emergency.

In this article, we’ll walk you through what’s required when it comes to fire extinguisher signage in Brisbane, where signs should be placed, and how to stay compliant with Queensland fire safety laws.

## Why Fire Extinguisher Signage Is Important

Fire extinguisher signs are a legal and safety requirement in commercial and industrial buildings. They help people quickly identify the type and location of each extinguisher, ensuring the right action can be taken in the event of a fire. Every second counts during an emergency, and clear, visible signage eliminates confusion and delays.

These signs usually feature **white text and symbols on a red background** and must indicate both the extinguisher’s location and its class (e.g. ABE, CO₂, Water, Foam). This allows users to identify which type of fire the extinguisher is suitable for, reducing the risk of improper use.

## Fire Extinguisher Sign Placement in Brisbane

Correct placement of fire extinguisher signage is just as important as having the right extinguisher installed. In Brisbane and more broadly under **Australian Standard AS 2444:2001**, signs must be:

- Mounted at least **2 metres above floor level**, or positioned so they are easily visible from a distance.
- Installed directly above or near the extinguisher.
- Placed in **clear unobstructed locations** they must not be hidden behind furniture or placed too high or too low.
- Located along **emergency exit paths**, where they are easy to find and access.

The goal is to ensure that anyone staff, visitors, or first responders can quickly spot the signage and reach the extinguisher without barriers.

## Brisbane Fire Extinguisher Testing Requirements

In addition to correct signage, fire extinguishers and other fire protection equipment in Brisbane must be regularly tested and serviced.

Under **Australian Standard 1851 2012**, businesses must:

- Have all fire extinguishers, fire blankets, and fire hose reels **serviced every six months**.
- Ensure extinguishers undergo **hydrostatic pressure testing every 5 years**.
- Keep accurate records of all inspections and maintenance.

Failing to meet these servicing requirements can result in penalties and increased liability in the event of an incident.
